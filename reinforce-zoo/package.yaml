description: See <https://github.com/Sentenai/reinforce README.md>.
    @reinforce@ is a library which exports an OpenAI-gym-like
    typeclass, @MonadEnv@, with both an interface to the
    <https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api/ gym-http-api>, as well as
    haskell-native environments which provide a substantial speed-up to the
    http-server interface.

    This is an environment-first library, with basic reinforcment
    learning algorithms being developed on branches in subpackages (see
    <https://github.com/Sentenai/reinforce#development-and-milestones
    Development and Milestones>). @reinforce@ is currently an "alpha"
    release since it still needs some work defining some formal structures
    around what state-spaces and action-spaces should look like,
    however haskell's typesystem is expressive enough that this seems to be
    more of a "nice-to-have."

    It's in active development and has some beginner-friendly contributions -
    from porting new gym environments to implementing new algorithms.
